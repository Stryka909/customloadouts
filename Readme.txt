Bliss Package for random pre-made loadouts
Simple code for random chance of pre-made spawn loadouts..

To enable detection of new player spawns,
u need to alter your default inventory spawn to ["New Player"] in your instance table.

Note:- All the spawn loadouts are hardcoded, u need to edit file to adjust to what u want.
